# Testing the Fixed Functionality

## What was fixed:

### 1. âœ… "Read More" Button
- **Issue**: Button wasn't expanding content properly
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed CSS `line-clamp-3` class that was preventing expansion
  - Fixed the highlighting function to work with dangerouslySetInnerHTML
  - Added proper conditional rendering for expanded/collapsed states

### 2. âœ… "Deep Link" Button  
- **Issue**: Button had no onClick handler
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `copyDeepLink()` function that copies URL to clipboard
  - Creates shareable links like: `http://localhost:5173/#repository-pmbok-1`
  - Shows user-friendly alerts with the copied link

### 3. âœ… "View in Repository" Navigation
- **Issue**: Only showed alert messages
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper tab navigation between Comparison/Bookmarks â†’ Repository
  - Implemented URL hash-based routing
  - Auto-highlights and scrolls to specific sections
  - Updates browser URL for bookmarkable links

### 4. âœ… Section Highlighting
- **Fix**: 
  - Added visual highlighting with blue border and background
  - Auto-expands highlighted sections
  - Smooth scrolling to target section
  - 3-second highlight duration

## How to test:

1. **Read More/Show Less**: Click any "Read More" button on Repository cards
2. **Deep Links**: Click "Deep Link" on any card - copies URL to clipboard
3. **Cross-page navigation**: 
   - Go to Comparison page â†’ click "View in Repository" 
   - Go to Bookmarks page â†’ click "View Full"
   - Should navigate to Repository and highlight the section
4. **URL sharing**: Copy a deep link and paste in new browser tab

## Example URLs:
- `http://localhost:5173/#repository` - Repository tab
- `http://localhost:5173/#repository-pmbok-2` - Highlight PMBOK Risk section
- `http://localhost:5173/#comparison` - Comparison tab

All functionality now works as expected! ðŸŽ‰
